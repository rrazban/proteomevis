During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the Mediator complex assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. Elongation is influenced by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II largest subunit (RPB1), which serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing. Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. In elongating Pol II, the lid loop (RPB1) appears to act as a wedge to drive apart the DNA and RNA strands at the upstream end of the transcription bubble and guide the RNA strand toward the RNA exit groove located near the base of the largely unstructured CTD domain of RPB1. The rudder loop (RPB1) interacts with single-stranded DNA after separation from the RNA strand, likely preventing reassociation with the exiting RNA. The cleft is surrounded by jaws: an upper jaw formed by portions of RBP1, RPB2 and RPB9, and a lower jaw, formed by RPB5 and portions of RBP1. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template, mainly by RPB5 direct contacts to DNA.",DNA binding [GO:0003677]; DNA-directed 5'-3' RNA polymerase activity [GO:0003899]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872],0

It is one of 5 proteins constituting the COPII coat, which is involved in anterograde (ER to Golgi) double-membrane transport vesicle formation.

The polymerization of COPII coat complexes then causes physically the deformation (budding) of the membrane, leading to the creation of a transport vesicle. The COPII complex is dissociated upon SAR1-GTP hydrolysis to SAR1-GDP. SEC23 functions as the SAR1 GTPase activating protein, whose activity is stimulated in the presence of SEC13/31. SEC13 is directly or indirectly required for normal ER membrane and nuclear envelope morphology. It also functions as a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). NPC components, collectively referred to as nucleoporins (NUPs), can play the role of both NPC structural components and of docking or interaction partners for transiently associated nuclear transport factors.

This complex then targets to the endoplasmic reticulum by membrane-bound receptors GET1 and GET2, where the tail-anchored protein is released for insertion. This process is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. ATP binding drives the homodimer towards the closed dimer state, facilitating recognition of newly synthesized TA membrane proteins. ATP hydrolysis is required for insertion. Subsequently, the homodimer reverts towards the open dimer state, lowering its affinity for the GET1-GET2 receptor, and returning it to the cytosol to initiate a new round of targeting. Cooperates with the HDEL receptor ERD2 to mediate the ATP-dependent retrieval of resident ER proteins that contain a C-terminal H-D-E-L retention signal from the Golgi to the ER.

Associates with different cyclins, that control kinase activity, substrate specificity and subcellular location of the kinase. Favorable growth conditions always result in activated cyclin-CDK complexes. Regulates metabolic processes when associated with PHO80 cyclin family members (PH080, PCL6, PCL7, PCL8 and PCL10), and cell cycle and morphogenesis processes when associated with PCL1,2 cyclin family members (PCL1, PCL2, CLG1, PCL5 and PCL9). When associated with PHO80, negatively regulates the expression of phosphate-starvation-responsive genes under phosphate-rich conditions. The PHO80-PHO85 cyclin-CDK holoenzyme phosphorylates and inactivates the transcription factor PHO4 by promoting its export to the cytoplasm. PHO80-PHO85 phosphorylates and inactivates protein kinase RIM15 by retaining it in the cytoplasm, antagonizing RIM15-induced entry into stationary phase. PHO80-PHO85 also phosphorylates and inactivates the calcineurin-responsive transcription factor CRZ1, linking cyclin-CDK activity to calcium signaling.

When associated with cyclins PCL1 and PCL2, positively controls degradation of sphingoid long chain base kinase LCB4 via phosphorylation of LCB4, which is required for its ubiquitination and degradation. PCL1-PHO85 also phosphorylates HMS1, NCP1 and NPA3, which may all have a role in mitotic exit.

When covalently bound, it is conjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as a monomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lys residues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linear polymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linear polyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, and DNA-damage responses. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed. When polyubiquitin is free (unanchored-polyubiquitin), it also has distinct roles, such as in activation of protein kinases, and in signaling (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.; FUNCTION: 40S ribosomal protein S31: Component of the ribosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell.

Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, and DNA-damage responses. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed. When polyubiquitin is free (unanchored-polyubiquitin), it also has distinct roles, such as in activation of protein kinases, and in signaling (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.; FUNCTION: 60S ribosomal protein L40-A: Component of the ribosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell.

At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery.

SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIIF is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIIF functions include the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter bound DNA-TBP-TFIIB complex, decreasing the affinity of RNA polymerase II for non-specific DNA, allowing for the subsequent recruitment of TFIIE and TFIIH, and facilitating RNA polymerase II elongation (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TAF14 acts as a chromatin reader that specifically recognizes and binds histones that are acylated (PubMed:26341557, PubMed:27089029). Recognizes and binds histone H3 acetylated or crotonylated at 'Lys-9' (H3K9ac and H3K9cr, respectively) (PubMed:26341557, PubMed:27089029).

Cluster assembly on ISU1/ISU2 depends on the function of the cysteine desulfurase complex NFS1-ISD11, which serves as the sulfur donor for cluster synthesis, the iron-binding protein frataxin (YFH1) as the putative iron donor, and the electron transfer chain comprised of ferredoxin reductase ARH1 and ferredoxin YAH1, which receive their electrons from NADH.

Appears to have a role in recruitment of telomerase and CDC13 to the telomere and the subsequent telomere elongation. Required also for telomere recombination to repair telomeric ends in the absence of telomerase. KU70, of the KU70/KU80 heterodimer, binds to the stem loop of TLC1, the RNA component of telomerase. Involved in telomere maintenance. Interacts with telomeric repeats and subtelomeric sequences thereby controlling telomere length and protecting against subtelomeric rearrangement. Maintains telomeric chromatin, which is involved in silencing the expression of genes located at the telomere.

TORC1 regulates multiple cellular processes to control cell growth in response to environmental signals. Nutrient limitation and environmental stress signals cause inactivation of TORC1. Active TORC1 positively controls ribosome biogenesis via control of rRNA, ribosomal protein and tRNA gene expression, and rRNA processing. TORC1 positively controls protein biosynthesis by regulation of mRNA stability, translation initiation factor activity, and high-affinity amino acid permeases that serve to provide amino acids for use by the translation machinery. TORC1 also promotes growth by sequestering a number of nutrient and general stress-responsive transcription factors in the cytoplasm. TORC1 negatively controls macroautophagy, a process to recycle surplus cytoplasmic mass under nutrient starvation conditions. TORC1 controls many of these processes via TIP41-TAP42-mediated inhibition of the type 2A-related phosphatases PP2A and SIT4 (PubMed:10198052, PubMed:10329624, PubMed:10604478, PubMed:11741537, PubMed:15620355, PubMed:7606777, PubMed:8741837, PubMed:9539725, PubMed:9843498).

Phosphorylates kinase SCH9 at 6 amino acids in the C-terminus, activating SCH9 kinase activity to properly regulate ribosome biogenesis, translation initiation, and entry into stationary phase (PubMed:17560372). TORC2 regulates cell cycle-dependent polarization of the actin-cytoskeleton, cell wall integrity, and receptor endocytosis. TORC2 controls polarity of the actin cytoskeleton, which is required for orienting the secretory pathway toward discrete growth sites, via the RHO1/PKC1/MAPK cell integrity pathway by activating the RHO1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor ROM2. TORC2 phosphorylates the AGC kinase YPK2, an upstream effector of the cell integrity pathway.

Era mutant era1 suppresses some temperature-sensitive mutations that affect DNA replication and chromosome partitioning and segregation.

During environmental stress such as cold shock or excessive cell density at stationary phase, stabilizes the 70S ribosome against dissociation, inhibits translation elongation and increases translation accuracy (PubMed:11375931, PubMed:15219834). When normal growth conditions are restored, is quickly released from the ribosome (PubMed:11375931). Has been suggested to inhibit translation elongation by blocking the A-site (aminoacyl-tRNA site) (PubMed:11375931). Has also been suggested to inhibit translation initiation by blocking the A-site and P-site (peptidyl-tRNA site) of the ribosome (PubMed:15502846, PubMed:23420694). At 15 degrees Celsius binds 30S subunits and stimulates their association with 50S subunits into idle 70S ribosomes (PubMed:23420694). Crystallization with T.thermophilus 70S ribosomes shows it binds in the channel between the head and body of the 30S subunit, where mRNA, tRNAs, initiation factors IF1 and IF3 and elongation factor G would bind; this protein's extended tail follows the mRNA channel and probably prevents RMF binding, which would prevent ribosome dimerization (PubMed:22605777). This protein also stabilizes the 30S head relative to the rest of the ribosome, which may also prevent dimerization (PubMed:22605777). Counteracts miscoding (translation errors) particularly efficiently at magnesium concentrations close to those observed in vivo but less efficiently at higher concentrations (PubMed:15219834).

The rate-limiting step is amino acid activation in the presence of tRNA (PubMed:18997014). The 2'-OH of the acceptor base (adenine 76, A76) of tRNA(Thr) and His-309 collaborate to transfer L-Thr to the tRNA; substitution of 2'-OH of A76 with hydrogen or fluorine decreases transfer efficiency 760 and 100-fold respectively (PubMed:18997014).

614,2kc8.A,P0C077,relE b1563 JW1555,,"Toxic component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system (PubMed:9767574). A sequence-specific, ribosome-dependent mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits translation during amino acid starvation (the stringent response). In vitro acts by cleaving mRNA with high codon specificity in the ribosomal A site between positions 2 and 3. The stop codon UAG is cleaved at a fast rate while UAA and UGA are cleaved with intermediate and slow rates. In vitro mRNA cleavage can also occur in the ribosomal E site after peptide release from peptidyl-tRNA in the P site as well as on free 30S subunits (PubMed:12526800). In vivo cuts frequently in the first 100 codons, most frequently after the second and third base and rarely near the stop codon (PubMed:21324908). Overexpression of RelE results in the inhibition of bacterial growth and a sharp decrease in colony-forming ability which is neutralized by the labile cognate antitoxin RelB. Overexpression also sharply increases persisters (cells that neither grow nor die in the presence of bactericidal agents and are largely responsible for high levels of biofilm tolerance to antimicrobials) (PubMed:15576765). mRNA interferases play a role in bacterial persistence to antibiotics; overexpression of this protein induces persisters resistant to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin (PubMed:21788497). Plays a role in dormancy when expressed in high-density cells in the absence of antitoxin RelB; amino acid starvation and an unidentified extracellular factor promote dormancy, while expression of antitoxin RelB restores cell culturability (PubMed:22210768). Acts with RelB as a corepressor of relBE transcription, considerably increasing the repression of RelB alone. 2 RelB dimers bind to 2 operator sequences; DNA-binding and repression is stronger when complexed with toxin/corepressor RelE by conditional cooperativity (PubMed:9767574, PubMed:19747491, PubMed:18501926, PubMed:22981948). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11274135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11717402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12123459, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12526800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15576765, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18501926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18532983, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19747491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20005802, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21324908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21788497, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22210768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22981948, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24251350, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9767574}.; FUNCTION: Seems to be a principal mediator of cell death in liquid media (PubMed:19707553).

The cleaved mRNA can be translated into RelE, leading to a positive feedback cycle of RelE expression.

Initially reported to act as a cotranscription factor with MqsA (PubMed:19690171, PubMed:20105222). Following further experiments, the MqsR-MqsA complex does not bind DNA and all reported data are actually due to a small fraction of free MqsA alone binding DNA.

Cleavage has been reported to occur on either side of G in the sequence GCU (PubMed:19690171). Also reported to cleave after C in GC(A/U) sequences (PubMed:19943910). There are only 14 genes in E.coli W3110 (and probably also MG1655) that do not have a GCU sequence and thus are resistant to the mRNA interferase activity; among these is the gene for toxin GhoT. Overexpression of MqsR causes cessation of cell growth and inhibits cell proliferation via inhibition of translation as well as increasing persister cell formation; these effects are overcome by concomitant or subsequent expression of antitoxin MqsA. Cross-talk can occur between different TA systems. Ectopic expression of this toxin induces transcription of the relBEF TA system operon with specific cleavage of the relBEF mRNA produced (PubMed:23432955). Regulates the expression of GhoT/GhoS, a type V TA system (PubMed:23289863). Persistence depends on toxin GhoT activity, which MqsR controls at the post-transcriptional level by selectively degrading the antitoxin ghoS segment of the ghoST mRNA (PubMed:23289863). Persister cells exhibit antibiotic tolerance without genetic change. mRNA interferases play a role in bacterial persistence to antibiotics; overexpression of this protein induces persisters resistant to coiprofloxacin and ampicillin (PubMed:21788497).

CRISPR clusters contain sequences complementary to antecedent mobile elements and target invading nucleic acids. CRISPR clusters are transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNA (crRNA). The Cas1-Cas2 complex is involved in CRISPR adaptation, the first stage of CRISPR immunity, being required for the addition/removal of CRISPR spacers at the leader end of the CRISPR locus (PubMed:24920831, PubMed:25707795, PubMed:24793649). The Cas1-Cas2 complex introduces staggered nicks into both strands of the CRISPR array near the leader repeat and joins the 5'-ends of the repeat strands with the 3'-ends of the new spacer sequence (PubMed:24920831). Spacer DNA integration requires supercoiled target DNA and 3'-OH ends on the inserted (spacer) DNA and probably initiates with a nucleophilic attack of the C 3'-OH end of the protospacer on the minus strand of the first repeat sequence (PubMed:25707795). Expression of Cas1-Cas2 in a strain lacking both genes permits spacer acquisition (PubMed:24793649, PubMed:24920831). Non-specifically binds DNA; the Cas1-Cas2 complex preferentially binds CRISPR-locus DNA (PubMed:24793649).

The protospacer DNA lies across a flat surface extending from 1 Cas1 dimer, across the Cas2 dimer and contacting the other Cas1 dimer; the 23 bp-long ds section of the DNA is bracketed by 1 Tyr-22 from each of the Cas1 dimers (PubMed:26478180, PubMed:26503043). Cas1 cuts within the 3'-overhang, to generate a 33-nucleotide DNA that is probably incorporated into the CRISPR leader by a cut-and-paste mechanism (PubMed:26478180). Cas1 alone endonucleolytically cleaves linear ssRNA, ssDNA and short (34 base) dsDNA as well as branched DNA substrates such as Holliday junctions, replication forks and 5'-flap DNA substrates (PubMed:21219465). In vitro catalyzes a concerted transesterification reaction on branched DNA, as would be expected during integration of protospacers into the CRISPR leader sequence; Cas2 is not required in vitro. This reaction requires a 3'-OH group at the branch point (PubMed:26284603). Genetic interactions suggest Cas1 interacts with components of the RecBC and RuvB DNA repair systems (PubMed:21219465). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21219465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21255106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24793649, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24920831, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25707795, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26284603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26478180}.",5'-flap endonuclease activity [GO:0017108]; crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease activity [GO:0008821]; DNA binding [GO:0003677]; identical protein binding [GO:0042802]; metal ion binding [GO:0046872],1

Persistence may be ultimately due to global remodeling of the persister cell's ribosomes (PubMed:25425348). Phosphorylates Glu-tRNA-ligase (AC P04805, gltX, on 'Ser-239') in vivo (PubMed:24095282, PubMed:24343429). Phosphorylation of GltX prevents it from being charged, leading to an increase in uncharged tRNA(Glu). This induces amino acid starvation and the stringent response via RelA/SpoT and increased (p)ppGpp levels, which inhibits replication, transcription, translation and cell wall synthesis, reducing growth and leading to persistence and multidrug resistance (PubMed:24095282, PubMed:24343429, PubMed:25848049). Once the level of HipA exceeds a threshold cells become dormant, and the length of dormancy is determined by how much HipA levels exceed the threshold (PubMed:20616060). The hipA7 mutation (a double G22S D291A mutation) leads to increased generation of persister cells (cells that survive antibiotic treatment) probably by entering into a dormant state, as well as cold-sensitivity (PubMed:14622409, PubMed:16707675). Wild-type cells produce persisters at a frequency of 10(-6) to 10(-5) whereas hipA7 cells produce about 100-fold more persisters (PubMed:14622409, PubMed:16707675, PubMed:25425348). hipA7 decreases the affinity for antitoxin HipB, leading to increased HipA levels and persistence (PubMed:20616060); depending on the protein level, can be toxic enough to reduce cell growth or even kill cells. Generation of persister cells requires (p)ppGpp as cells lacking relA or relA/spoT generate fewer or no persister cells respectively compared to hipA7 (PubMed:14622409, PubMed:25848049). Generation of persister cells by HipA also requires mRNA interferase toxins (such as MazF, RelE or YafO) and Lon protease; a strain deleted for 10 type II TAs does not produce persisters when HipA (or HipA7) is expressed, nor does a lon deletion strain or bacteria with alterations of polyphosphate levels, although levels of (p)ppGpp increase (PubMed:25848049). The toxic effect of HipA is neutralized by its cognate antitoxin HipB (PubMed:20616060). Also neutralized by overexpression of gltX (PubMed:24343429, PubMed:28430938).

Even at permissive temperatures the ts mutant (Gln-80/Asn-85) shows disrupted 50S ribosomal subunit assembly, defects in 16 and 23S rRNA processing and altered association of some late-assembling ribosomal proteins (PubMed:11555285). Dissociates from the pre-50S ribosome under conditions of amino acid starvation. The levels of (p)ppGpp rise in the ts mutant (Gln-80/Asn-85), possibly because ObgE controls SpoT. Binds GDP and ppGpp with the same affinity. During ribosome assembly ObgE acts later than the rRNA methyltransferase RrmJ and DEAD-box RNA helicases DeaD and SrmB. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11555285, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11976298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15292126, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15836769, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16980477, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17616600, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19555460, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24844575}.",DNA binding [GO:0003677]; GDP binding [GO:0019003]; GTPase activity [GO:0003924]; GTP binding [GO:0005525]; guanyl ribonucleotide binding [GO:0032561]; magnesium ion binding [GO:0000287]; ribosomal large subunit binding [GO:0043023]; rRNA binding [GO:0019843],1

The beta chain is required for initiation of replication as well as for processivity of DNA replication (PubMed:3519609, PubMed:2040637). A single clamp can bind both Pol III and IV, allowing the repair Pol IV to access DNA when it is damaged and needs to be fixed, a process the replicative polymerase cannot perform; when DNA is repaired Pol III takes over again (PubMed:16168375).

A sequence-specific endoribonuclease it inhibits protein synthesis by cleaving mRNA and inducing bacterial stasis. It is stable, single-strand specific with mRNA cleavage independent of the ribosome, although translation enhances cleavage for some mRNAs (PubMed:18854355). Cleavage occurs at the 5'-end of ACA sequences, yielding a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and a free 5'-OH, although cleavage can also occur on the 3'-end of the first A (PubMed:15537630, PubMed:23280569). Digests 16S rRNA in vivo 43 nts upstream of the C-terminus; this removes the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence forming a mixed population of wild-type and stress ribosomes. Stress ribosomes do not translate leader-containing mRNA but are proficient in translation of leaderless mRNA, which alters the protein expression profile of the cell; MazF produces some leaderless mRNA (PubMed:21944167). The toxic endoribonuclease activity is inhibited by its labile cognate antitoxin MazE. Toxicity results when the levels of MazE decrease in the cell, leading to mRNA degradation. This effect can be rescued by expression of MazE, but after 6 hours in rich medium overexpression of MazF leads to programmed cell death (PubMed:8650219, PubMed:11222603). MazF-mediated cell death occurs following a number of stress conditions in a relA-dependent fashion and only when cells are in log phase; sigma factor S (rpoS) protects stationary phase cells from MazF-killing (PubMed:15150257, PubMed:19251848). Cell growth and viability are not affected when MazF and MazE are coexpressed. Both MazE and MazE-MazF bind to the promoter region of the mazE-mazF operon to inhibit their own transcription. MazE has higher affinity for promoter DNA in the presence of MazF (PubMed:25564525). Cross-talk can occur between different TA systems, ectopic expression of this toxin induces transcription of the relBEF TA system operon with specific cleavage of the mRNA produced (PubMed:23432955). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11071896, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11222603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15150257, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15537630, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18854355, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19251848, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21944167, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23280569, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23432955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25564525, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8650219}.; FUNCTION: Might also serve to protect cells against bacteriophage; in the presence of MazE-MazF fewer P1 phage are produced than in a disrupted strain. For strain K38 most wild-type cells are killed but not by phage lysis; it was suggested that MazE-MazF causes P1 phage exclusion from the bacterial population. This phenomenon is strain dependent. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15316771}.; FUNCTION: The physiological role of this TA system is debated. Programmed cell death (PCD) occurs when cells are at high density and depends on the presence of MazE-MazF and a quorum sensing pentapeptide, the extracellular death factor (EDF) with sequence Asn-Asn-Trp-Asn-Asn (NNWNN), probably produced from the zwf gene product glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (PubMed:17962566, PubMed:18310334). Cell death governed by the MazE-MazF and DinJ-YafQ TA systems seems to play a role in biofilm formation, while MazE-MazF is also implicated in cell death in liquid media (PubMed:19707553). Implicated in hydroxy radical-mediated cell death induced by hydroxyurea treatment (PubMed:20005847, PubMed:23416055). In conjunction with EDF prevents apoptotic-like death (ALD) in the presence of DNA damaging agents, probably by reducing recA mRNA levels in a non-endonuclease-mediated manner (PubMed:22412352). Other studies (in strains BW25113 and MC4100, the latter makes EDF) demonstrate MazF does not cause PCD but instead bacteriostasis and possibly a dormant state as well as persister cell generation (PubMed:24375411). mRNA interferases play a role in bacterial persistence to antibiotics; overexpression of this protein induces persisters resistant to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin (PubMed:21788497). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17962566, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18310334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19707553, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20005847, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21419338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21788497, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22412352, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23416055, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24375411, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8650219}.",DNA binding [GO:0003677]; endoribonuclease activity [GO:0004521]; protein-containing complex binding [GO:0044877]; protein homodimerization activity [GO:0042803]; RNA binding [GO:0003723],1

Thus, functions as a protein deglycase that repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated proteins, and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. Deglycates cysteine, arginine and lysine residues in proteins, and thus reactivates these proteins by reversing glycation by glyoxals. Is able to repair glycated serum albumin, collagen, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and fructose biphosphate aldolase. Acts on early glycation intermediates (hemithioacetals and aminocarbinols), preventing the formation of Schiff bases and advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) that cause irreversible damage (PubMed:25416785, PubMed:26774339). Also functions as a nucleotide deglycase able to repair glycated guanine in the free nucleotide pool (GTP, GDP, GMP, dGTP) and in DNA and RNA. Is thus involved in a major nucleotide repair system named guanine glycation repair (GG repair), dedicated to reversing methylglyoxal and glyoxal damage via nucleotide sanitization and direct nucleic acid repair. However, is less efficient than Hsp31 and YhbO, suggesting that YajL might be preferentially dedicated to protein repair (PubMed:28596309). Displays a covalent chaperone activity with sulfenylated thiol proteins by forming mixed disulfides with members of the thiol proteome, and preferentially with sulfenylated cellular proteins, upon oxidative stress; these mixed disulfides can be subsequently reduced by low-molecular-weight thiols to regenerate YajL and reduced proteins (PubMed:22157000, PubMed:22321799).
