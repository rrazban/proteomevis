Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. Elongation is influenced by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II largest subunit (RPB1), which serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing. Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. In elongating Pol II, the lid loop (RPB1) appears to act as a wedge to drive apart the DNA and RNA strands at the upstream end of the transcription bubble and guide the RNA strand toward the RNA exit groove located near the base of the largely unstructured CTD domain of RPB1. The rudder loop (RPB1) interacts with single-stranded DNA after separation from the RNA strand, likely preventing reassociation with the exiting RNA. The cleft is surrounded by jaws: an upper jaw formed by portions of RBP1, RPB2 and RPB9, and a lower jaw, formed by RPB5 and portions of RBP1. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template, mainly by RPB5 direct contacts to DNA.",,1,,0

It is one of 5 proteins constituting the COPII coat, which is involved in anterograde (ER to Golgi) double-membrane transport vesicle formation. First the small GTPase SAR1, activated by and binding to the integral ER membrane protein SEC12, exchanges GDP for GTP and recruits the heterodimer SEC23/24, which in turn recruits the heterotetramer SEC13-SEC31. The polymerization of COPII coat complexes then causes physically the deformation (budding) of the membrane, leading to the creation of a transport vesicle. The COPII complex is dissociated upon SAR1-GTP hydrolysis to SAR1-GDP. SEC23 functions as the SAR1 GTPase activating protein, whose activity is stimulated in the presence of SEC13/31. SEC13 is directly or indirectly required for normal ER membrane and nuclear envelope morphology. It also functions as a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC).

When associated with cyclins PCL1 and PCL2, positively controls degradation of sphingoid long chain base kinase LCB4 via phosphorylation of LCB4, which is required for its ubiquitination and degradation. PCL1-PHO85 also phosphorylates HMS1, NCP1 and NPA3, which may all have a role in mitotic exit. PCL2-PHO85 also phosphorylates RVS167, linking cyclin-CDK activity with organization of the actin cytoskeleton. When associated with PCL5, positively controls degradation of transcription factor GCN4 via phosphorylation of GCN4, which is required for its degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(Cdc4). When associated with PCL9, may have a role in bud site selection in G1 phase.

Essential for vegetative growth. Functions as a component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complexes SAGA, SALSA and SLIK. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIIF is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIIF functions include the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter bound DNA-TBP-TFIIB complex, decreasing the affinity of RNA polymerase II for non-specific DNA, allowing for the subsequent recruitment of TFIIE and TFIIH, and facilitating RNA polymerase II elongation (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TAF14 acts as a chromatin reader that specifically recognizes and binds histones that are acylated (PubMed:26341557, PubMed:27089029). Recognizes and binds histone H3 acetylated or crotonylated at 'Lys-9' (H3K9ac and H3K9cr, respectively) (PubMed:26341557, PubMed:27089029). Component of the SWI/SNF complex, an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, is required for the positive and negative regulation of gene expression of a large number of genes (PubMed:12672490).

First, a [2Fe-2S] cluster is transiently assembled on the scaffold proteins ISU1 and ISU2. In a second step, the cluster is released from ISU1/ISU2, transferred to glutaredoxin GRX5, followed by the formation of mitochondrial [2Fe-2S] proteins, the synthesis of [4Fe-4S] clusters and their target-specific insertion into the recipient apoproteins. Cluster assembly on ISU1/ISU2 depends on the function of the cysteine desulfurase complex NFS1-ISD11, which serves as the sulfur donor for cluster synthesis, the iron-binding protein frataxin (YFH1) as the putative iron donor, and the electron transfer chain comprised of ferredoxin reductase ARH1 and ferredoxin YAH1, which receive their electrons from NADH.

Is able to repair glycated serum albumin, collagen, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and fructose biphosphate aldolase.

A sequence-specific, ribosome-dependent mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits translation during amino acid starvation (the stringent response). In vitro acts by cleaving mRNA with high codon specificity in the ribosomal A site between positions 2 and 3. The stop codon UAG is cleaved at a fast rate while UAA and UGA are cleaved with intermediate and slow rates. In vitro mRNA cleavage can also occur in the ribosomal E site after peptide release from peptidyl-tRNA in the P site as well as on free 30S subunits (PubMed:12526800). In vivo cuts frequently in the first 100 codons, most frequently after the second and third base and rarely near the stop codon (PubMed:21324908). Overexpression of RelE results in the inhibition of bacterial growth and a sharp decrease in colony-forming ability which is neutralized by the labile cognate antitoxin RelB. Overexpression also sharply increases persisters (cells that neither grow nor die in the presence of bactericidal agents and are largely responsible for high levels of biofilm tolerance to antimicrobials) (PubMed:15576765). mRNA interferases play a role in bacterial persistence to antibiotics; overexpression of this protein induces persisters resistant to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin (PubMed:21788497). Plays a role in dormancy when expressed in high-density cells in the absence of antitoxin RelB; amino acid starvation and an unidentified extracellular factor promote dormancy, while expression of antitoxin RelB restores cell culturability (PubMed:22210768). Acts with RelB as a corepressor of relBE transcription, considerably increasing the repression of RelB alone. 2 RelB dimers bind to 2 operator sequences; DNA-binding and repression is stronger when complexed with toxin/corepressor RelE by conditional cooperativity (PubMed:9767574, PubMed:19747491, PubMed:18501926, PubMed:22981948). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11274135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11717402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12123459, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12526800, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15576765, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18501926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18532983, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19747491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20005802, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21324908, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21788497, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22210768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22981948, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24251350, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9767574}.; FUNCTION: Seems to be a principal mediator of cell death in liquid media (PubMed:19707553).

An mRNA interferase which has been reported to be translation-independent (PubMed:19690171, PubMed:19943910, PubMed:23289863). It has also been reported to be translation-dependent (PubMed:20041169). Cleavage has been reported to occur on either side of G in the sequence GCU (PubMed:19690171). Also reported to cleave after C in GC(A/U) sequences (PubMed:19943910). There are only 14 genes in E.coli W3110 (and probably also MG1655) that do not have a GCU sequence and thus are resistant to the mRNA interferase activity; among these is the gene for toxin GhoT. Overexpression of MqsR causes cessation of cell growth and inhibits cell proliferation via inhibition of translation as well as increasing persister cell formation; these effects are overcome by concomitant or subsequent expression of antitoxin MqsA. Cross-talk can occur between different TA modules. Ectopic expression of this toxin induces transcription of the relBEF TA module operon with specific cleavage of the relBEF mRNA produced (PubMed:23432955). Regulates the expression of GhoT/GhoS, a type V TA module (PubMed:23289863). Persistence depends on toxin GhoT activity, which MqsR controls at the post-transcriptional level by selectively degrading the antitoxin ghoS segment of the ghoST mRNA (PubMed:23289863). Persister cells exhibit antibiotic tolerance without genetic change. mRNA interferases play a role in bacterial persistence to antibiotics; overexpression of this protein induces persisters resistant to coiprofloxacin and ampicillin (PubMed:21788497). Overexpression leads to a dramatic increase in tolerance to the antibiotic ofloxacin.

1530,3NKD,Q46896,ygbT cas1 b2755 JW2725,,"CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat), is an adaptive immune system that provides protection against mobile genetic elements (viruses, transposable elements and conjugative plasmids) (PubMed:21255106, PubMed:24920831, PubMed:24793649). CRISPR clusters contain sequences complementary to antecedent mobile elements and target invading nucleic acids. CRISPR clusters are transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNA (crRNA). The Cas1-Cas2 complex is involved in CRISPR adaptation, the first stage of CRISPR immunity, being required for the addition/removal of CRISPR spacers at the leader end of the CRISPR locus (PubMed:24920831, PubMed:25707795, PubMed:24793649). The Cas1-Cas2 complex introduces staggered nicks into both strands of the CRISPR array near the leader repeat and joins the 5'-ends of the repeat strands with the 3'-ends of the new spacer sequence (PubMed:24920831). Spacer DNA integration requires supercoiled target DNA and 3'-OH ends on the inserted (spacer) DNA and probably initiates with a nucleophilic attack of the C 3'-OH end of the protospacer on the minus strand of the first repeat sequence (PubMed:25707795). Expression of Cas1-Cas2 in a strain lacking both genes permits spacer acquisition (PubMed:24793649, PubMed:24920831). Non-specifically binds DNA; the Cas1-Cas2 complex preferentially binds CRISPR-locus DNA (PubMed:24793649). Highest binding is seen to a dual forked DNA complex with 3'-overhangs and a protospacer-adjacent motif-complement specifically positioned (PubMed:26478180). The protospacer DNA lies across a flat surface extending from 1 Cas1 dimer, across the Cas2 dimer and contacting the other Cas1 dimer; the 23 bp-long ds section of the DNA is bracketed by 1 Tyr-22 from each of the Cas1 dimers (PubMed:26478180, PubMed:26503043). Cas1 cuts within the 3'-overhang, to generate a 33-nucleotide DNA that is probably incorporated into the CRISPR leader by a cut-and-paste mechanism (PubMed:26478180). Cas1 alone endonucleolytically cleaves linear ssRNA, ssDNA and short (34 base) dsDNA as well as branched DNA substrates such as Holliday junctions, replication forks and 5'-flap DNA substrates (PubMed:21219465). In vitro catalyzes a concerted transesterification reaction on branched DNA, as would be expected during integration of protospacers into the CRISPR leader sequence; Cas2 is not required in vitro. This reaction requires a 3'-OH group at the branch point (PubMed:26284603). Genetic interactions suggest Cas1 interacts with components of the RecBC and RuvB DNA repair systems (PubMed:21219465). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21219465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21255106, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24793649, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24920831, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25707795, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26284603, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26478180}.",,1,,1

Persistence may be ultimately due to global remodeling of the persister cell's ribosomes (PubMed:25425348). Phosphorylates Glu-tRNA-ligase (AC P04805, gltX, on 'Ser-239') in vivo (PubMed:24095282, PubMed:24343429). Phosphorylation of GltX prevents it from being charged, leading to an increase in uncharged tRNA(Glu). This induces amino acid starvation and the stringent response via RelA/SpoT and increased (p)ppGpp levels, which inhibits replication, transcription, translation and cell wall synthesis, reducing growth and leading to persistence and multidrug resistance (PubMed:24095282, PubMed:24343429, PubMed:25848049). Once the level of HipA exceeds a threshold cells become dormant, and the length of dormancy is determined by how much HipA levels exceed the threshold (PubMed:20616060). The hipA7 mutation (a double G22S D291A mutation) leads to increased generation of persister cells (cells that survive antibiotic treatment) probably by entering into a dormant state, as well as cold-sensitivity (PubMed:14622409, PubMed:16707675). Wild-type cells produce persisters at a frequency of 10(-6) to 10(-5) whereas hipA7 cells produce about 100-fold more persisters (PubMed:14622409, PubMed:16707675, PubMed:25425348). hipA7 decreases the affinity for antitoxin HipB, leading to increased HipA levels and persistence (PubMed:20616060); depending on the protein level, can be toxic enough to reduce cell growth or even kill cells. Generation of persister cells requires (p)ppGpp as cells lacking relA or relA/spoT generate fewer or no persister cells respectively compared to hipA7 (PubMed:14622409, PubMed:25848049). Generation of persister cells by HipA also requires mRNA interferase toxins (such as MazF, RelE or YafO) and Lon protease; a strain deleted for 10 type II TAs does not produce persisters when HipA (or HipA7) is expressed, nor does a lon deletion strain or bacteria with alterations of polyphosphate levels, although levels of (p)ppGpp increase (PubMed:25848049). The toxic effect of HipA is neutralized by its cognate antitoxin HipB (PubMed:20616060). Also neutralized by overexpression of gltX (PubMed:24343429, PubMed:28430938).

Thus, functions as a protein deglycase that repairs methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated proteins, and releases repaired proteins and lactate or glycolate, respectively. Deglycates cysteine, arginine and lysine residues in proteins, and thus reactivates these proteins by reversing glycation by glyoxals. Is able to repair glycated serum albumin, collagen, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and fructose biphosphate aldolase. Acts on early glycation intermediates (hemithioacetals and aminocarbinols), preventing the formation of Schiff bases and advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) that cause irreversible damage (PubMed:25416785, PubMed:26774339). Also functions as a nucleotide deglycase able to repair glycated guanine in the free nucleotide pool (GTP, GDP, GMP, dGTP) and in DNA and RNA. Is thus involved in a major nucleotide repair system named guanine glycation repair (GG repair), dedicated to reversing methylglyoxal and glyoxal damage via nucleotide sanitization and direct nucleic acid repair. However, is less efficient than Hsp31 and YhbO, suggesting that YajL might be preferentially dedicated to protein repair (PubMed:28596309). Displays a covalent chaperone activity with sulfenylated thiol proteins by forming mixed disulfides with members of the thiol proteome, and preferentially with sulfenylated cellular proteins, upon oxidative stress; these mixed disulfides can be subsequently reduced by low-molecular-weight thiols to regenerate YajL and reduced proteins (PubMed:22157000, PubMed:22321799).
